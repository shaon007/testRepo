# Syft Git Search App

![alt text](https://github.com/shaon007/Syftapp_kotlin_mvvm/blob/master/app/src/main/res/drawable/screenshot_syftapp.JPG)

The app generates search results in the form of a list as the user types in text into the search field. 

There is an additional filter function next to the search box, this opens a dialog with the options to filter results by topic and language categories.

A total count of the search result is shown below the search field.

The results are sorted by the order of their star rating from high to low. The results display git name, language followed by a truncated description.
